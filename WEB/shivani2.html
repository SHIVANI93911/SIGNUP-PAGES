            <p>A healthy diet is a diet that maintains or improves overall health. A healthy diet provides the body 
               with essential nutrition: fluid, macronutrients such as protein, micronutrients such as vitamins, and 
               adequate fibre and food energy.A healthy diet may contain fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, and may 
               include little to no ultra-processed foods or sweetened beverages. The requirements for a healthy diet can 
               be met from a variety of plant-based and animal-based foods, although additional sources of vitamin B12 are 
               needed for those following a vegan diet. Various nutrition guides are published by medical and governmental 
               institutions to educate individuals on what they should be eating to be healthy. Nutrition facts labels are also 
               mandatory in some countries to allow consumers to choose between foods based on the components relevant to health.</p>
               <h4>WHO telling about some suggestions to take care about our health diet</h4>
               <p>The World Health Organization (WHO) makes the following five recommendations with respect to both populations and individuals:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Maintain a healthy weight by eating roughly the same number of calories that your body is using.</li>
                <li>Limit intake of fats to no more than 30% of total caloric intake, preferring unsaturated fats to saturated fats. Avoid trans fats.</li>
                <li>Eat at least 400 grams of fruits and vegetables per day (not counting potatoes, sweet potatoes, cassava, and other starchy roots). 
                    A healthy diet also contains legumes (e.g. lentils, beans), whole grains, and nuts.</li>
                <li>Limit the intake of simple sugars to less than 10% of caloric intake (below 5% of calories or 25 grams may be even better)</li>
                <li>Limit salt/sodium from all sources and ensure that salt is iodized. Less than 5 grams of salt per day can reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.</li>

           <p>"Junk food" is a term used to describe food that is high in calories from sugar and/or fat, and possibly 
            sodium, making it hyperpalatable, but with little dietary fiber, protein, vitamins, minerals, or other important 
            forms of nutritional value.[1][2][3] It is also known as HFSS food (high in fat, salt and sugar).[4] The term junk food
             is a pejorative dating back to the 1950s.[5] Many variations of junk food can be easily found in most supermarkets and 
             fast food restaurants. Due to easy accessibility, commercially-oriented packaging, and often-low prices, people are most 
             likely to consume it.Precise definitions vary by purpose and over time. Some high-protein foods, like meat prepared with 
             saturated fat, may be considered junk food.[7] Fast food and Fast food restaurant are often equated with junk food, although 
             fast foods cannot be categorically described as junk food.[8][9][10] Most junk food is ultra-processed food.
             Concerns about the negative health effects resulting from a junk food-heavy diet, especially obesity, have resulted in public 
             health awareness campaigns, and restrictions on advertising and sale in several countries. Current studies indicate that a diet 
             high in junk food can increase the risk of depression, digestive issues, heart disease and stroke, type 2 diabetes, cancer, and early death.</p>
